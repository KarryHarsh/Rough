Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) development involves a range of activities such as data preparation, model training, and model deployment. It can be challenging to manage the dependencies required for each stage of ML development. MLflow is a popular open-source platform that enables managing the ML lifecycle. However, managing dependencies and version upgrades in MLflow can be challenging. To resolve this, we propose the development of a Onetru SDK layer that communicates with MLflow server using Onetru API. This SDK layer can be installed independently of MLflow packages and can communicate with the MLflow server, thus avoiding code changes in MLflow packages.

Proposed Solution
The proposed solution involves developing a Onetru SDK layer that communicates with MLflow server using Onetru API. The SDK layer can be installed independently of the MLflow packages and can communicate with the MLflow server, thus avoiding code changes in MLflow packages. This SDK layer can be used to host MLflow server independently so that we can upgrade MLflow version with a simple package upgrade. The Onetru SDK layer is a communication layer that communicates with MLflow API and Onetru instance. The Onetru instance can be hosted on a separate server or on the same server as MLflow server.

The Onetru SDK layer can be developed using Python, and it can be installed using pip. The SDK layer can be initialized with the Onetru API key and Onetru instance URL. Once the SDK layer is initialized, it can communicate with the MLflow server using the MLflow API. The SDK layer can also communicate with the Onetru instance to manage the MLflow server. The SDK layer can be integrated with Jupyter notebooks to enable notebook communication with the MLflow server.

Benefits
The Onetru SDK layer provides several benefits for managing the MLflow server and dependencies:

Independent hosting of MLflow server: The Onetru SDK layer enables hosting the MLflow server independently of the MLflow packages. This allows upgrading the MLflow version with a simple package upgrade, without any impact on the Onetru SDK layer.

Simplified MLflow dependency management: The Onetru SDK layer enables simplified dependency management of MLflow packages. This simplifies the process of managing dependencies for each stage of ML development.

Seamless integration with Jupyter notebooks: The Onetru SDK layer can be integrated with Jupyter notebooks to enable seamless communication with the MLflow server. This allows for streamlined ML development using notebooks.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Onetru SDK layer can be developed to simplify MLflow dependency management and enable independent hosting of MLflow server. This SDK layer can be integrated with Jupyter notebooks to enable streamlined ML development using notebooks. The Onetru SDK layer can be installed using pip and initialized with the Onetru API key and Onetru instance URL. The SDK layer can communicate with the MLflow server using the MLflow API and can also communicate with the Onetru instance to manage the MLflow server.
